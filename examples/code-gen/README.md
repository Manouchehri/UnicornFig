# Generating Go Code

Unicorn is able to generate code in golang that contains a struct to parse configuration data into
as well as functions that will open configuration (JSON or YAML) files and parse their contents
into the configuration struct provided.

To instruct Unicorn to generate such a file, simply pass the `-go <filename>` flag.

The generated Go source code file will be prescribed the package `config` and will contain:

1. A `Configuration` struct
2. A `LoadConfigJson(string) (Configuration, error)` function that accepts a JSON file name
3. A `LoadConfigYaml(string) (Configuration, error)` function that accepts a YAML file name

As demonstrated in `program.go`, after placing a generated `config.go` file in a config `config/`
directory, we can simply import the `config` package and parse a generated `config/config.json`
file into an instance of `config.Configuration`.

## This Example

The configuration data in this example was generated by running Unicorn on the Fig file
`config/test.fig` using the command (from this directory)

    ../../unicorn -json config/out.json -yaml config/out.yaml -go config/config.go config/test.fig

The Fig file in question defines some information about a hypothetical API that our fictional
`program.go` service might want to invoke, as well as some information about the service itself
(such as the port and address it should run on).
